# DnDMe
DnDMe is an attempt to create a means to play D&amp;D with a party of players. DnDMe is mostly python based.


With the "Map-Maker", you can take any birds-eye top down bitmap image of an island, etc, and convert it into a D&D map sized appropriately for a D&D map.

With the "charactermaker", you can create your own D&D character and stats will be distributed according to the class etc chosen, keeping within the scope of your chosen class.
